		<h1>What was leadership like in Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia?</h1>
		<p>
			Leadership in Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia both had Monarchist governments. Mesopotamia had a king,
			and Ancient Egypt had a Pharaoh who was believed to be the human form of a god.
		</p>
		<p>
			In Ancient Egypt, old documents have been discovered and preserved and have clues written on
			papyrus that help understand what their government was like back then. They had memorandums owned by
			their government that detailed their shipment of goods. Private and official letters have been found
			along with some of their authors and time periods. There are tons of other ancient artifacts that have been
			found that help us understand more about Ancient Egypt.
		</p>
		<p>
			In Mesopotamia, one thing that really helped with understanding their government was Hammurabi's Code,
			a written code of law that was created by Hammurabi, who was also the biggest and best leader in Mesopotamia.
			Hammurabi's Code contained 282 laws, of which were very specific.
